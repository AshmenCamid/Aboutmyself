            <P>This page highlights some of the things I hold dear in life—my favorite food, couples who inspire me, and people who have shaped my world. Each one plays an important role in who I am today.</P>

<h2 style="color: blueviolet;">Favorite Food</h2>
<div class="images">
    <img src="adobo.jpeg"  style="border-radius: 10px;  width: 400px; height: 250px;">
    <img src="shrimp.jpg"  style="border-radius: 10px;  width: 400px; height: 250px;">
   
        <p>My favorite food is Adobong Manok and Shrimp, a delicious Filipino dish that perfectly combines the savory flavors of chicken and the rich, delicate taste of shrimp. Cooked in a flavorful blend of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and spices, this dish offers a perfect balance of salty, sour, and umami flavors that make every bite satisfying.

            What makes Adobong Manok and Shrimp special is its cultural significance and versatility. It’s a staple in Filipino households, enjoyed during family gatherings and special occasions. The tender chicken absorbs the rich marinade, while the shrimp adds a touch of elegance and a unique sweetness to the dish.
            
            Beyond its incredible taste, this dish represents tradition and comfort. Whether paired with steamed rice or enjoyed on its own, Adobong Manok and Shrimp is a timeless favorite that never fails to bring joy and a sense of home.

        <p> Ms. Xyla and Mr. Charbel are my favorite couple because of their love, 
            respect, and support for each other. Their bond, built on
             trust and understanding, is inspiring. I first got to know them through 
             their shared love for playing Mobile Legends (ML), where their teamwork
              in the game reflects the strength of their real-life relationship. They face challenges together with positivity and resilience, making their connection even more admirable. Their story reminds me of the beauty of true love and lasting commitment.
